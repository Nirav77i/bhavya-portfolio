            After I dropped out (getting cut off from my parents).<br />
            I was propelled by a passion for innovation and a vision for a greater
            world,<br />
            knowing I could make a massive impact if I stayed true to that
            mission. <br />
            This bold decision marked the beginning of an extraordinary career in
            technology and philanthropy. I view my life as potentially millennia
            long, and thus a century of commitment seems like nothing in the grand
            scheme.

          A bit about my education. During my senior year of high-school I was
          chosen as the Scholar Athlete of The Year and, I received All Decade
          Defensive-End award while playing Varsity Football. I denied a D1
          offer to Naval academy in the pursuit of saving my most precious
          organ, my brain. I scored perfect Math and Science ACT Scores Placing
          in 99.9% for US (27 in reading which you may notice here on the site).
          I then (reluctantly) enrolled into University of Arizona to study
          Management of Information systems. My true dream was to build a
          business, but my parents grew up in the go to college, get a job
          mindset and tried their best to instill that upon me. MIS was chosen
          as it torted being a part of the business school, something I naively
          believed to be centered around Entrepreneurship. Realizing my mistake
          after 1 semester, I decided to opt for a skill, and switch to Computer
          Science.

          I searched the world wide web for a community with the same passion
          that I had, and found nothing. My ideologies can be most easily boiled
          down to a birth child of stociism and transhumanism. I boiled my
          philosophies down to basic claims and had nights and nights of debates
          with others that led me feeling a stronger and stronger passion to my
          beliefs. I decided to create what my younger self needed most, a
          community that made sense in the grand possibilties of the universe.
          That took into account all the craziest explanantions, and the fact
          that we truly cannot be certain what life is, but still gave reasoning
          on how best to utilize time moving forward.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am motivated in business solely to grow my visions and spread the
          knowledge that makes me so excited about our present, and our future.

          inspiring others to achieve their potential and contribute positively
          to society and am in the process of switching all my ownership in
          companies to be owned by Systemic Altruism, the non-profit I started.
          I've always been commited to helping the world, but one project made
          this internal fire go into hyper-drive. The act of building houses in
          Bangaldesh, for less than the price of some Dior shoes I owned made me
          redefine how I looked at status. One of my favorite ideas for systemic
          change became the idea of redefining status.
